# Aerolist Travel module #

I want to re-implement all the logic of Aerolist from Python to Golang and then migrate it.  
I don't know how much time will it take and will I actually finish it or not but I'm willing to at least give it a try.
My first module of choice to re-implement is travel which is in my opinion is the main module of the app.
